Colours ReadMe

The target of this project is to implement a clone of the famous web browser game "colour switch" of xxx to get familiar with the distributed game development platforms UNITY and GIT-Hub.

An running implementation of the game can be found at: http://www.jetztspielen.de/spiel/color-switch

After starting the game the scene shows a ball with a dedicated colour, the first obstacle, a level counter and a button to pause the game.

The ball has a "natural" gravity movement downwards and the ball will explode if it crashes with another object of a different colour and the game is over.

The only action of the player is to click somewhere on the screen to kick the ball upwards until the "natural" gravity moves it again downwards. The camera will follow the movement of the ball.

The colour of the ball will automatically change randomly if the ball hits a "Farbwechsler"

Each obstacle has a level target marker. If the ball hits a level target marker the level is completed and the level counter is increased by one.

There is a limited number of obstacles implemented in the game with an increasing level of difficulty
